    Some biologists consider viruses to be non-living because they lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesize new products. Some hold that, because viruses do have genetic material and can employ the metabolism of their host, they can be considered organisms. Also, an emerging concept that is gaining traction among some virologists is that of the virocell, in which the actual phenotype of a virus is the infected cell, and the virus particle (or virion) is merely a reproductive or dispersal stage, much like pollen or a spore.[4]

    The smallest viruses in terms of genome size are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Perhaps the most famous is the bacteriophage Phi-X174 with a genome size of 5,386 nucleotides.[5] However, some ssDNA viruses can be even smaller. For example, Porcine circovirus type 1 has a genome of 1,759 nucleotides[6] and a capsid diameter of 17 nm (1.7Ã—10âˆ’5 mm).[7] As a whole, the viral family geminiviridae is about 30 nm (3.0Ã—10âˆ’5 mm) in length. However, the two capsids making up the virus are fused; divided, the capsids would be 15 nm (1.5Ã—10âˆ’5 mm) in length. Other environmentally characterized ssDNA viruses such as CRESS DNA viruses, among others, can have genomes that are considerably less than 2,000 nucleotides.[8][9]
    
    The smallest RNA virus in terms of genome size is phage BZ13 strain T72 at 3,393 nucleotides length.[10] Viruses using both DNA and RNA in their replication (retroviruses) range in size from 7,040 to 12,195 nucleotides.[11] The smallest double-stranded DNA viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb and 42 nm (4.2Ã—10âˆ’5 mm); parvoviruses have smaller capsids, at 18â€“26 nm (1.8Ã—10âˆ’5â€“2.6Ã—10âˆ’5 mm), but larger genomes, at 5 kb. It is important to consider other self-replicating genetic elements, such as satelliviruses, viroids and ribozymes.
    
    Animals (Animalia)
    Several species of Myxozoa (obligately parasitic cnidarians) never grow larger than 20 Î¼m (0.020 mm).[12] One of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 Î¼m (0.0085 mm) when fully grown, making it the smallest known animal.[13]
    
    Molluscs (Molluska)
    Bivalvia
    The shell of the nut clam Condylonucula maya grows 0.54 mm (0.021 in) long.[14]
    
    Gastropods (Gastropoda)
    
    Ammonicera minortalis
    The smallest water snail (of all snails) is Ammonicera minortalis in North America, originally described from Cuba. It measures 0.32 to 0.46 mm (0.013 to 0.018 in).[15][16]
    
    The smallest land snail is Acmella nana. Discovered in Borneo, and described in November 2015, it measures 0.7 mm (0.028 in).[17] The previous record was that of Angustopila dominikae from China, which was reported in September 2015. This snail measures 0.86 mm (0.034 in).[18]
    
    Cephalopods (Cephalopoda)
    Further information: Cephalopod size
    Maximites was the smallest known ammonoid. Adult specimens reached only 10 mm (0.39 in) in shell diameter.[19]
    
    Arthropods (Arthropoda)
    Arachnids (Arachnida)
    There is a debate about which spider is smallest. According to Guinness World Records, "Two contenders are from the Symphytognathidae genus Patu: males of Patu digua described in Colombia had a body length of 0.37 millimetres (0.015 inches), while the Samoan moss spider (P. marplesi) could be as small as 0.4 millimetres (0.016 inches) long."[20] Other possible smallest spider species are the Frade cave spider known as Anapistula ataecina, and the dwarf orb weaver (Anapistula caecula), the females of which are 0.43 mm (0.017 in) and 0.48 mm (0.019 in) respectively.[20] Males of both species are potentially smaller than the females, but no Anapistula ataecina or Anapistula caecula have been measured yet.[20]
    Cochlodispus minimus is the smallest mite. An adult individual measured with a body length of 79 Î¼m (0.079 mm).[21] However, PBS claims "The tiniest mite on record is 82 microns long" but does not name a species.[22]
    Non-hexapod crustaceans (Crustacea)
    The smallest crustacean is the tantulocarid Stygotantulus stocki, at a length of 94 Î¼m (0.094 mm).[23]
    
    Insects (Insecta)
    Adult males of the parasitic wasp Dicopomorpha echmepterygis can be as small as 139 Î¼m (0.139 mm) long, smaller than some species of protozoa (single-cell creatures); females are 40% larger.[24] Megaphragma caribea from Guadeloupe, measuring 170 Î¼m (0.17 mm) long, is another contender for smallest known insect in the world.
    Beetles of the tribe Nanosellini are all less than 1 mm (0.039 in) long; the smallest confirmed specimen is of Scydosella musawasensis at 325 Î¼m (0.325 mm) long; a few other nanosellines are reportedly smaller, in historical literature, but none of these records have been confirmed using accurate modern tools. These are among the tiniest non-parasitic insects.[25]
    
    Western pygmy blue (Brephidium exilis thompsoni)
    The western pygmy blue (Brephidium exilis) is one of the smallest butterflies in the world, with a wingspan of about 1 cm (0.39 in).[26]
    Echinoderms (Echinodermata)
    The smallest sea cucumber, and also the smallest echinoderm, is Psammothuria ganapati, a synaptid that lives between sand grains on the coast of India. Its maximum length is 4 mm (0.16 in).[27] [28]
    
    Sea urchins
    The smallest sea urchin, Echinocyamus scaber, has a test 6 mm (0.24 in) across.[28]
    
    Starfish
    Patiriella parvivipara is the smallest starfish, at 5 mm (0.20 in) across.[28]
    
    Fish (Pisces)
    Main article: List of smallest fish
    One of the smallest vertebrates and the smallest fish based on the minimum size at maturity is Paedocypris progenetica from Indonesia, with mature females measuring as little as 7.9 mm (0.31 in) in standard length.[29] This fish, a member of the carp family, has a translucent body and a head unprotected by a skeleton.
    One of the smallest fish based on the minimum size at maturity is Schindleria brevipinguis from Australia, their females reach 7 mm (0.28 in) and males 6.5 mm (0.26 in).[30] Males of S. brevipinguis have an average standard length of 7.7 mm (0.30 in); a gravid female was 8.4 mm (0.33 in).[31] This fish, a member of the goby family, differs from similar members of the group in having its first anal fin ray further forward, under dorsal fin 4.
    Male individuals of the anglerfish species Photocorynus spiniceps have been documented to be 6.2â€“7.3 mm (0.24â€“0.29 in) at maturity, and thus claimed to be a smaller species. However, these survive only by sexual parasitism and the female individuals reach the significantly larger size of 50.5 mm (1.99 in).[32][33][34][35]</P>
